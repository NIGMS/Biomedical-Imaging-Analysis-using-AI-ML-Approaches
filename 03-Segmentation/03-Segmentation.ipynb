    "## Why segmentation?\n",
    "---\n",
    "In the previous submodules, we demonstrated how a deep learning neural network can bin images into distinct groups based on features within the image. However, these network architectures only allow for a _single_ classification output and lack any _spatial information_. This limitation may not be ideal for large images that contains more than one class within the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a self-driving car that is powered by artificial intelligence. Self-driving cars have a large amount of cameras, sensors, etc. that are used to inform the onboard computer about the surrounding environment. When a self-driving car acquires a snapshot of its surroundings (which happens ~30 times a second), the computer must evaluate the collected information and decide if the vehicle is going to accelerate, brake, turn, etc. One important step of this process is to identify its surrounding environment, which is difficult to do with a single output using a traditional neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, when an image is taken, a trained neural network can be scanned, or _convolved_, across an entire image to eventually build up a spatial classification map of its surroundings. This type of process has previously been used in many applications, including segmenting neuronal membranes in biomedical images [<a href=\"#Reference1\" class=\"intrnllnk\">1</a>]. Overall, however, this approach is relatively time consuming, and can not be completed before the next snapshot arrives for a self-driving car.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more elegant approach is to generate a _fully convolutional_ neural network. As a brief refresher from the classification submodule: deep learning neural networks _encode_ information from the input image, typically with a _max pooling_ layer, which takes the maximum of an output map within a small region. This process in turn decreases the size of the output map by half while keeping the most important features. When this process is done multiple times, spatial information from the input image is encoded and used to predict a class from the image. However, once features from an image are encoded, they can also be _decoded_, and by performing the same number of encoding and decoding steps, a pixel-wise classification map can be produced. When this network architecture is drawn out, the shape of the encoding/decoding steps results in a \"U\" shape, resulting in the network being called a \"U-Net\" [<a href=\"#Reference2\" class=\"intrnllnk\">2</a>].

    "In this submodule, we discussed and explored the use of segmentation. This type of segmentation is a powerful tool for generating pixel-wise classification maps, rather than a single classification for an entire input image. To demonstrate this, we generated a U-Net CNN architecture, and trained the network to segment different regions of skin within fluorescence images."
