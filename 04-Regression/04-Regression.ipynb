    "In previous submodules we looked at classification and segmentation to predict the next label. The label is a finite set of distinct values. However, that is not always be the case and the predicted value may need to be continuous and can take on an infinite set of values. In this case we use a method called `Regression`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a statistical process that estimates the relationship between a dependent (also called *response* or *label*) and one or more independent variables (also called *predictors*, *covariates* or *features*).  Regression can be linear or non-linear depending on the relationship between the the dependent and independent variables. Regression is useful for estimating/predicting or forecasting the next value in a sequence and the linear regression can be represented as:\n",

If there is only one independent variable, then it is referred to as *univariate* regression and if there are multiple variables then it is referred to as *multivariate* regression.\n",

We will begin the implementation of regression by using a simple example with tabular data. For tabular data we use Pythonâ€™s `scikit-learn` library, a very popular library for data analysis and implementing regression. Regression can also be implemented using machine learning. For implementing regression in machine learning we use the pytorch library. \n",

    "In this module, we implemented regression using different methods. We studied tabular data and estimated the radius of a cancerous tumor. We looked at how to extract the most relevant features can be extracted and how these features effect the MAE and RMSE metrics. The feature extraction significantly improved MAE and RMSE for random forest, decision tree and pytorch regression models but RMSE and MAE for linear regression was increased. \n"
